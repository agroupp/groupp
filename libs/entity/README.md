# entity

This library was built to simplify work with MongoDb. It's not one more ORM and preserves the
benefits of `document db` conception. It gives you repository abstraction with the
abstract class `MongoBaseRepository` that you will extend by your own repository classes.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test entity` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
